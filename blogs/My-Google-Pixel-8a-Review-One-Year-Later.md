# Pixel 8a Review: My 365 Day Verdict on the Mid Range King

It's been a full year since I got my hands on the Google Pixel 8a in that beautiful Bay Blue. My journey with Google phones goes way back to 2016 when my dad had a Nexus 5X, and I've always loved the pure, stock Android experience. After finding a deal for around ₹30,000, My dad got it for me. A year later, here are my thoughts.

### What I Absolutely Loved

The first thing you notice is the **design and screen**. The Bay Blue colour is fantastic, and the display is absolutely incredible. The colours are so beautiful and vibrant, it's a joy to look at. Paired with the surprisingly great speakers, listening to music at full volume is a fantastic experience.

But the real magic of a Pixel is the **software**. Getting the latest updates promptly and having that clean, bloat free (Google Bloat > Oter Bloat) interface is something I've really enjoyed. It’s a definite quality jump from my old OnePlus 5T, and I’ve had no network issues either it’s been solid.

And then there are the **cameras**. For subjects that are close up, the photos are simply stunning. I would say I've taken some of the best photos with this phone.

### Room for Improvement

No phone is perfect, especially at this price. The **battery is just alright**. It gets me through most of my day, but I find myself topping it up whenever I get the chance. The phone also tends to get a little warmer than I'd like, but it's nothing compared to the older pixels.

My biggest complaint is the zoom. The lack of a **telephoto lens** is very noticeable, and zoomed in shots are quite bad. I also feel the night photos could be quite bad sometimes.

### Final Verdict: 8/10

For the price I paid, the Pixel 8a has delivered in every area that matters most to me. It's a solid 8/10. It's left me excited about the Pixel ecosystem, and I'd love to see what the latest Pixel 10 Pro has to offer.
