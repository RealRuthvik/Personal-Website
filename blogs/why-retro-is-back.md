The web has come a long way since the early 2000s. Back then, websites were simple, fast, and often quirky. Today, as design trends cycle and nostalgia grows, we're seeing a resurgence of retro web design principles—think bold colors, pixel fonts, visible borders, and layouts that prioritize clarity over complexity.

## Why the Nostalgia?
Nostalgia is a powerful force. For many developers and users, the web of the past represents a time when creativity flourished and the barriers to entry were low. There were fewer rules, and experimentation was encouraged. The aesthetic of that era—table layouts, animated GIFs, and monospaced type—evokes a sense of fun and authenticity.

## Simplicity and Speed
Modern web design can sometimes feel overwhelming, with heavy frameworks and endless animations. Retro-inspired sites, by contrast, are often lightweight and fast. They focus on delivering content without distractions, making them accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
